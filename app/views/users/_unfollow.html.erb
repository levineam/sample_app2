<!-- html generated by this code: <form action="/relationships/117"

We are setting the variable data-remote to "true" inside the form tag
which tells Rails to allow the form to be handled by JavaScript. In
previous versions of rails you'd have to insert the full JS code. Next
have to enable the Relationships controller to respond to Ajax requests -->
